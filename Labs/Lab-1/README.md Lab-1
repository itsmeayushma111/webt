OBJECT:Elements of HTML

THEORY:

A) List:

1) Unordered list:An unordered list starts with the <ul> tag. Each list item starts with the <li> tag.Typically, unordered list items are displayed with a bullet, which can be of several forms, like a dot, a circle, or a square. The bullet style is not defined in the HTML description of the page, but in its associated CSS, using the list-style-type property.

2) Ordered list:An ordered list starts with the <ol> tag. Each list item starts with the <li> tag.
type: Sets the numbering type:

a for lowercase letters
A for uppercase letters
i for lowercase Roman numerals
I for uppercase Roman numerals
1 for numbers (default)
The specified type is used for the entire list unless a different type attribute is used on an enclosed <li> element.

3) Nested list:The list that are inside a list are known as nested list.

B) Semantic tags:A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.
Examples of non-semantic elements: <div> and <span> - Tells nothing about its content.
Examples of semantic elements: <form>, <table>, and <article> - Clearly defines its content.

C) Text Formatting tags:Formatting elements were designed to display special types of text:

<b> - Bold text
<strong> - Important text
<i> - Italic text
<em> - Emphasized text
<mark> - Marked text
<small> - Smaller text
<del> - Deleted text
<ins> - Inserted text
<sub> - Subscript text
<sup> - Superscript text

D) Audio, Video and Image:The <audio> element is used to embed audio files to a web page, and the <video> element is used to embed a video and the <img> tag is used to embed images.

E) iframe:The HTML Inline Frame element (iframe) represents a nested browsing context, embedding another HTML page into the current one.
